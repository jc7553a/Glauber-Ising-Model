# Glauber-Ising-Model
Classical Glauber Ising Model I made with Professor Anzi Hu American University for her research on quantum modeling under effective temperature

This project was run on the American University Cluster, so I wouldn't try running it on a laptop that will not work due to the extremely large stack size and global variable size. 

The jpegs represents first Average magnetism over a time step interval of 200, the curve shows a smooth curve going from -10 up to 0 over time showing the effects of temperature. The second is the Average Correlation of the spins from the mid time step to the end. It shows a high peak and sharp decay showing that the spins over time don't correlate with each other.
