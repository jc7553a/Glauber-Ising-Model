# Glauber-Ising-Model
Classical Glauber Ising Model I made with Professor Anzi Hu American University for her research on quantum modeling under effective temperature

This project was run the American University Cluster, so I wouldn't try running it on a laptop that will not work due to the extremely large stack size and global variable size.
